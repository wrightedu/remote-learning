# Wright State CS Dept. Setup guide

The purpose of this guide is to get you setup and ready for any software 
requirements that might come at you during your academic career at Wright 
State University.

### Starting point
We're assuming you have a windows 10 system that is fully updated.  There 
will be some Mac and Linux tips towards the end but Mac OS does not support
all of the needed software in our program (without some paid licenses) and if
you are using Linux you should be good to go out of the box (for the most part).

## Getting your system ready for coding

### Windows system tweaks and installs
* Change your folder options so that you can see hidden files and folders, 
  we're in Computer Science, hidden things don't scare us!
* Trackpad settings, down motion should scroll down, there... I said it, get out
  of here "natural scrolling" (this is obviously a personally preference but if you 
  prefer otherwise you might be wrong).
* [Enable Windows Subsystem for Linux.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
* Install Ubuntu 20.04 from the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/wslstore)

### Basic Software
There is a great website I have been using for years that downloads and installs
a number of packages without any of the bloatware that typically comes with them.

https://ninite.com/

We will use ninite.com to get the following software:
* Chrome
* Firefox
* Discord
* WinSCP
* Visual Studio Code
* 7-Zip
* Java Adopt OpenJDK x64 11.0.11
* Steam... (for games ;)

After you select what you want from the above click "Get Your Ninite" to get 
an installer.  Run that installer to install the selected software for you.

In addition to the tools from ninite, I would strongly recommend [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html).
MobaXterm provides a great interface to the Windows Subsystem for Linux tools
we installed earlier.  Speaking of, now that Maxterm is installed we should 
finish setting up WSL Ubuntu by launching MobaXterm, selecting a WSL ubuntu
terminal, and creating a username and password for our new WSLinux Ubuntu 
install.

### Language Support
We're only going to focus on three languages here: Java, python, and c++.

* [Java (JDK)](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk14&jvmVariant=hotspot).  This should have been installed by default with ninite installer above.
  * For this installer just accept all defaults and you're done

* [Python (Anaconda)](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.07-Windows-x86_64.exe)
  * For Anaconda, accept all defaults up until the Advanced Options screen.  On this screen select `Add Anaconda3 to my PATH environment variable`.
  * ![anaconda](images/anaconda.png) 

* [c++ (MinGW)](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/p15522)
  * This is just the MinGW installer installer, once you install it you need to run it and select the following packages for installation
    ![mingw](images/mingw.png)
  * After you select the above packages click on `Installation > Apply Changes` to install the selected packages.
  * I highly recommend you add the installation path `C:\MinGW\bin` to your default `PATH` environment variable.
  * Open your file explorer and right click on `This PC` and go to properties.
  * Click on **Advanced system settings**
  ![advanced](images/properties.png)
  * Click on the **Advanced** tab and click the **Environment Variables...** button at the bottom.
  ![Environment variables](images/env.png)
  * Click on the **Path** variable in the bottom window and click **Edit...**
  ![path](images/path.png)
  * Click the **New** button, enter `C:\MinGW\bin` then click **OK**

### Git
Next, you will need an account with GitHub, which is free.  Simply head to 
[GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and sign up.  I would recommend using your 
campus email and a professional username and profile pic since this might be a
future portfolio for your internships and job search.

After you create an account I would also install the following:

* [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
  * Accept defaults until you get to the `Choosing the default editor used by Git` screen, on this I would recommend selecting Visual Studio Code (not insider build) from the dropdown.
  ![git](images/git.png)
  * Accept all other defaults
  * After installation, run the Git Bash program and execute the following commands:
    * `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
    * `git config --global user.email "youremail@yourdomain.com"`
    * Note, substitute your name and email in the above commands inside the quote (keep the quotation marks)
* [GitHub Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/)

Finally, you may want to bookmark the online [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) 
book as it can come in handy when you've royally screwed something up...
