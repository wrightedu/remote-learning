## Setup Webex Sessions

    - Recommended settings:
    - Under "Choose your features", **check "Virtual Meetings"**, then select "Apply"
    - Under "Authorize with LMS", make sure it says "Authorized"

    - You can choose to setup a recurring meeting (sample in screenshot) or you can create meetings for each lecture separately
        - You cannot delete individual meetings in a recurring set

    - The "Upcoming" tab is where you select which meeting to "Start"
