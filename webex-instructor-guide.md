Add Webex to Pilot:
1. Log in to [pilot.wright.edu](pilot.wright.edu)
2. Select the course in which you want to use Webex - you will need to repeat this process for each course
3. Go to Content, and create a new module ("Add a module...")
4. Select "Add Existing Activities"
5. Select "External Learning Tools"
6. Scroll down and select "Webex"
7. This should add a clickable Webex link to your module.  
    - This is where you and students will go to access lecture sessions and recordings

## Setup Webex Sessions

- [WSU CTL Documentation](http://blogs.wright.edu/learn/pilot/2020/11/30/6518/)

1. When you first open Webex from your link added to the module you made in Content, you will need to setup the features you want to enable.
    - ![Webex setup](webex/webex-setup.PNG)
    - You can change this later - the Setup tab will remain accessible
    - Recommended settings:
    - Under "Choose your features", **check "Virtual Meetings"**, then select "Apply"
    - Under "Authorize with LMS", make sure it says "Authorized"
    - You can now setup meetings that if scheduled via Webex in Pilot students enrolled in the course can access
2. Under the "Virtual Meetings" tab, select "New Meeting".  
    - You can choose to setup a recurring meeting (sample in screenshot) or you can create meetings for each lecture separately
        - You cannot delete individual meetings in a recurring set
    - ![Webex recurring setup](webex/recurring-sample.PNG)
3. The "Meetings" tab has three mini tabs to select from - "Upcoming", "Past Meetings", and "Recordings"
    - The "Upcoming" tab is where you select which meeting to "Start"
    - When ready "Start" your meeting - students will not be able to join a meeting until it has been started

## Using Webex with in-room equipment
**Note: This is for Russ 346 and 355 / any room with a Webex panel and Cisco camera in the room**

1. In Pilot, go to your course, open Webex from your module in Content
2. Under the "Virtual Meetings" tab, look at your "Upcoming" meetings
3. "Start" the meeting to launch Webex
4. "Start meeting" once ready
5. If using the **in room instructor station**, you should now be connected to the room microphone, Cisco control panel (we're getting there) and the in-room camera.
    - If you want video to show for recording, you need to stop sharing content (screenshare / whiteboard / etc.)
6. If using **your own device** (laptop), you will need to connect to the room
    - Select the "..." icon in the bottom row of icons
    - Click "Connect to a Video System"
    - ![Webex video system](webex/connect-to-room.PNG)
    - A window will open where you can select which room to connect to
    - ![Webex connect to device](webex/connect-to-device.PNG)
    - You should now be connected to the room microphone, Cisco control panel (we're getting there) and the in-room camera.
    - If you want video to show for recording, you need to stop sharing content (screenshare / whiteboard / etc.)
7. You can choose to share your screen, which screen to share, or specific applications to share.
    - ![Webex share](webex/share-button.PNG)
8. You can now monitor text chat within Webex.  Depending on your configuration (see additional webex info), students who attend remotely can unmute their microphones and ask questions over the in-room speakers.
9. You can record your class (click the "Record" button)
    - ![Webex record](webex/record-button.PNG)
    - Make sure "Record in cloud" is the selected option
    - When recording, you can choose to "Pause" or "Stop" the recording.  
        - "Pause" will allow you to resume a recording session.  
        - "Stop" will finish the first recording, and "Start" would then start a new recording
10. When done with your session, select the red X and "End Meeting"
    - If students are still in the session, you can optionally "Leave Meeting" - you will leave, but the session remains on for those joined

## Camera Settings Using Webex Control Panel
**Note: This is for Russ 346 and 355 / any room with a Webex panel and Cisco camera in the room**

1. On the desk there is a white bordered touchscreen panel.  This is the Webex control panel
2. On the upper right of the panel screen, there is a camera icon with settings symbols overlayed.

    - Whiteboard: a view tailored to the room's whiteboard
    - **does this reset to anything after any time period / is there a default???**

## Office Hours
**This section is for the Office Hours tool via Webex.  You can still set up other methods, like using your personal Webex room**

- Office Hours via Pilot + Webex allow for you to create windows of your availability - students can then pick a time that works for them within your selected window
    - If you are familar with "whenisgood" or "youcanbookme" this feature is very similar to how those platforms operate
- To enable Office Hours, select the "Setup" tab 
    - Under "Choose your features", **check "Office Hours"**, then select "Apply"
- Select the Office Hours tab
- Select your hours of availability (this is for all weeks)
- Select meeting duration (30 minutes by default)
- Select default buffer time (if any) you would like between meetings
- ![Sample Office Hours view](webex/office-hours-sample.PNG)
- **Click Save** at the bottom once you are finished with your selections
- Students will see your available time slots only, can select a time, and can select "Confirm Meeting" to reserve the time slot
- Select "View My Meetings in Webex"
    - This will take you to the Webex portal, where you can join meetings with students who have reserved time slots.
- Office Hours DO span across courses where you have added Webex and selected "Office Hours" in the "Setup" options
    - TODO: test if students see taken times across courses
