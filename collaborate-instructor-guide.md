## Using Collaborate

1. Open Collaborate Ultra via the Communication dropdown in Pilot
2. In the Sessions menu, you can select the session you want to join (listed by date), then select "Join session"
3. If using the **in room instructor station**, you should now be connected to the room microphone, Cisco control panel (we're getting there) and the in-room camera.
    - Room microphone - MO-1 **NEEDS VERIFICATION**
    - Room camera - INOGENI (HD2USB3)
    - Can use control panel to change camera views
    - **MAKE SURE YOU UNMUTE AND SHARE YOUR VIDEO ONCE READY**

    - You only have your PC hardware (built in mic and camera) and any external hardware you want to add (external microphone)
    - **MAKE SURE YOU UNMUTE AND SHARE YOUR VIDEO ONCE READY**
5. You can choose to share your screen, which screen to share, or specific applications to share.
6. You can now monitor text chat within Collaborate.  Depending on your configuration, students who attend remotely can unmute their microphones and ask questions.
7. You can record your class:
    - In the upper left panel, click "Start Recording"
    - To stop the recording, in the upper left panel, click "Stop Recording"
8. When done with your session, open the upper left panel, then in the bottom left select "Leave Session"

## Camera Settings Using Webex Control Panel
