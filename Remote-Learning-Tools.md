# Remote Learning Tools

## Adding Webex to Pilot

Add Webex to Pilot:
1. Log in to [pilot.wright.edu](pilot.wright.edu)
2. Select the course in which you want to use Webex - you will need to repeat this process for each course
3. Go to Content, and create a new module ("Add a module...")
4. Select "Add Existing Activities"
5. Select "External Learning Tools"
6. Scroll down and select "Webex"
7. This should add a clickable Webex link to your module.  
    - This is where you and students will go to access lecture sessions and recordings

## Setup Webex Sessions

1. When you first open Webex from your link added to the module you made in Content, you will need to setup the features you want to enable.
    - ![Webex setup](webex/webex-setup.PNG)
    - You can change this later - the Setup tab will remain accessible
    - Recommended settings:
    - Under "Choose your features", **check "Virtual Meetings"**, then select "Apply"
    - Under "Authorize with LMS", make sure it says "Authorized"
    - You can now setup meetings that if scheduled via Webex in Pilot students enrolled in the course can access
2. Under the "Virtual Meetings" tab, select "New Meeting".  
    - You can choose to setup a recurring meeting (sample in screenshot) or you can create meetings for each lecture separately
        - You cannot delete individual meetings in a recurring set
    - ![Webex recurring setup](webex/recurring-sample.PNG)
3. The "Meetings" tab has three mini tabs to select from - "Upcoming", "Past Meetings", and "Recordings"
    - The "Upcoming" tab is where you select which meeting to "Start"
    - When ready "Start" your meeting - students will not be able to join a meeting until it has been started

## Using Webex with in-room equipment
**Note: This is for Russ 346 and 355 / any room with a Webex panel and Cisco camera in the room**

2. Under the "Virtual Meetings" tab, look at your "Upcoming" meetings
3. "Start" the meeting to launch Webex
4. "Start meeting" once ready
5. If using the **in room instructor station**, you should now be connected to the room microphone, Cisco control panel (we're getting there) and the in-room camera.
6. If using **your own device** (laptop), you will need to connect to the room
    - Select the "..." icon in the bottom row of icons

9. You can record your class (click the "Record" button)
    - ![Webex record](webex/record-button.PNG)
    - Make sure "Record in cloud" is the selected option

        - "Pause" will allow you to resume a recording session.  
        - "Stop" will finish the first recording, and "Start" would then start a new recording
10. When done with your session, select the red X and "End Meeting"
    - If students are still in the session, you can optionally "Leave Meeting" - you will leave, but the session remains on for those joined

## Using Webex Control Panel (changing camera views)

3. To change the current camera behavior, select that button.  You have options:
    - Whiteboard: a view tailored to the room's whiteboard
    - [Fill with right word]: a view of the whole room
    - [Fill with right word]: enables camera to track instructor
    - **does this reset to anything after any time period / is there a default???**
