 how to schedule a Zoom meeting room that is constantly open. The suggestion was to use your personal meeting room (which works wonderfully). But, another way to schedule a continually open Zoom room that is displayed in the list of meetings where all the other meetings show is to:

Click on "Schedule a New Meeting".
Give meeting a name (i.e. - Class Name Continually Open Zoom Room).
Click on "Recurring meeting".
In the "Recurrence" row, click down arrow and switch "Daily" for "No Fixed Time".
All the other choices are the same from what we learned in our training session.
The meeting is displayed in the "Upcoming Meetings" tab with all the others so it may be more intuitive for your students to find. You can also use your Pilot Demo Student to enter these rooms and try them out from a student perspective.

We are happy to answer any questions but you are welcome to attend any trainings here: https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360029527911
